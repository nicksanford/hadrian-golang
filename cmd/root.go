	Short: "WIP: A single binary debezium for postgres",
	Long: `
	THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS & NOT YET PRODUCTION READY

	Hadrian is a CLI that replicates postgres database changes for application
	consumption.

	It does this by connecting to a target posgres server as a logical streaming
	replication client, and outputs all database changes in a format applications
	can understand, such as json.

	Hadrian is intended to solve the dual write problem, described in Kleppmann's
	Bottled Water blog post, which frequently occur when multiple systems need to
	be notified of data changes in a given database.

	Debezium is currently the industry standard solution for this problem, however
	it requires both JVM and/or kafka expertise to use effectively.

	Hadrian is intended to provide a subset of debezium's features, so that small
	teams or single person projects without high availability or high throughput
	requirements can replicate data from their postgres databases to downstream
	systems without needing to change application code.

	Credits:
		Hadrian is a wrapper around @jackc's fantastic pglogrepl and was inspired by
		both cainophile: and supabase's realtime.
